## instructions to view (for NUVI)

1. $ npm install
2. $ webpack -w
3. open index.html (found in public folder)
4. Enjoy :)

## Side notes on project

1. I did the project in ReactJS because I saw that you guys at NUVI use ReactJS (If I am not mistaken).

2. Also did this to show that I am not just a MEAN stack developer, but that I am willing to learn and grow, and become the best developer I can be. Regardless of the framework, stack, or language I am using.

3. I understood the project as first something where you could add likes and comments to a persons("actors"), profile, this wasn't what I was asked to do (I came to learn) but I left parts of those features in the UI just to have them.

4. I understood the project was to build some kind of an Analytics view where you can view social media activities and how certain activities compare to other activities. I hope this was done correctly.

5. I used a bootstrap to build a clean and simple UI, (this is something I do not normally use.) I almost never use this, I do all of my own CSS(see @jtannerporter.com). I just used this for times sake to get the project in sooner and to focus more on the fact JavaScript(using mostly ES6) and ReactJS side.

6. Please do not look at me using bootstrap for this project as an indication that I cannot build my own UI, again I do all of my own CSS (see @jtannerporter.com). Thank you.

7. I am very excited for this opportunity and know that I am qualified for the job, and that I will be a good fit in the group. Thank you very much.




## Notes for me
This is a project to apply for NUVI social marketing suite.

## NUVI instructions
Part of our business is visualizing and interacting with social media activities, such as tweets, Facebook posts, and Instagram posts.

Getting Started
Your project is to write a browser UI that displays these activities and allows you to interact with the "actors" of these activities, such as liking or replying to these "actor

https://nuvi-challenge.herokuapp.com/activities

We have a RESTful JSON endpoint for data. It will always return an array of objects which describe the activity. This array could be empty but will typically include 10-500 social media activities.

Analysts using our product typically need to know what social media “provider’ it is from (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit), the username on that social media site, the content of the activity, including media, and when it was posted. Other meta data included in the activity is useful as well to represent but we also care about keeping a clean UI.

Once you’ve built this UI in JavaScript, commit it to a GitHub repo and send it our way. If it requires a build, please commit the built javascript as well and include a README.md if there are some special steps on how see the html and javascript.

##Bonus
Social Media Analysts use our product to take action on large quantities of activities and take actionable insights on them. Build a visualization that allows them to understand better how social media conversations about their brand are going, using the data provided.

##Bonus Bonus
Manually write an HTTP request to get the JSON data at the endpoint in a plain text file, include the cookie “SESSION” with the value of “NUVI-12345” and commit it as “request.txt”.
